            <p>
                I am an experienced professional with a diverse background in the real estate and financial sectors. As an Associate Director at Propnex Realty, I have demonstrated expertise in property sales, leasing, and investment strategies, successfully closing high-value deals and maintaining excellent client relationships. Prior to that, as a Senior Wealth Manager at Aviva Financial Advisers, I provided expert financial advice and personalized wealth management solutions to clients, optimizing their returns and fostering strong client relationships. Additionally, my experience as a Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance and Personal Banker at United Overseas Bank further honed my skills in comprehensive financial planning and customer service. With a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Management from Otto-Von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, I possess a solid educational foundation. I am currently looking to transition into the tech sector and actively learning Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
